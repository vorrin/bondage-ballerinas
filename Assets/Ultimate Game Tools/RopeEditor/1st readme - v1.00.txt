Introduction

The Ultimate Rope Editor is a powerful tool to add rope based physics to your games.
It can generate procedural ropes and also apply rope physics to your existing meshes.
The editor is fully what-you-see-is-what-you-get, physics included, because everything
can be created and configured using the Unity Editor in play mode.
As there is no need to stop and re-run to see the changes, setting everything up becomes
a much faster process. The rope editor allows each rope state to persist when exiting
from the play mode, this is extremely useful when keeping the current state to finish
editing later or to make it to to the actual game.
